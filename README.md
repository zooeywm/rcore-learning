# My rCore Learning

Follow the tutorial [rCore-tutorial-Book](https://rcore-os.cn/rCore-Tutorial-Book-v3/index.html), and I'm trying to finish every practices after each chapter.

I record most of my gains in the README in practice folder for each chapter, and some others are record on my [blog](https://zooeywm.github.io/blog/)

Hoping we can learn together!
