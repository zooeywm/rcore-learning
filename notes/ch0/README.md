## Divzero

Write a program that can produce an exception, and debug it, explain the process result of the OS.

From the gdb, we can infer that the exception is due to divide zero when the `idiv` instruction executed. Then jump to OS to handle the exception, the OS transfer it to a signal `SIGFPE`, use signal mechanism to handle the exception. The behavior of receiving `SIGFPE` of this program is abnormal termination, so OS terminate it and report the information to shell.

Note that the exception handle and signal is related to CPU architecture, for example, the divide zero behavior is not an exception on RISC-V, but a certain result.

## Program-a

Write a program that sleep 5s and print a string. Meanwhile, write it to a file.

## Program-b

Write a program that can reflect concurrency, asynchronism, shareability, and persistency.

## Debug Program-a

Use GDB to debug Program-a, can set breakpoint, single step execution, and view variable info.
